# Welcome to ghouliedocs

If you're reading this, you're probably watching Ghoulie, so thanks!  This aims to be a somewhat comprehensive guide, but he's also a dog, so keep that in mind.

## Where to start:

1. If you're watching him for a short period of time, the daily routine section should be enough.
2. If you're watching him for an extended period of time, the maintenance section might be necessary.
3. In case of emergencies, see the emergency section.
