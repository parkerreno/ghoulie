## Tips & Tricks

> [!WARNING]
> Ghoulie will adapt his walking style based on what he can get away with.  Use caution when letting him backtrack, cross the street, disagreeing on turns, etc as he will base much of this behavior on first impressions.

- Be assertive - he'll do what he can get away with.
- Do not attempt out & back routes - he can be very difficult to turn around.
- Be prepared for lots of sniffing.
- Bring at least three bags, he prefers to not poop at home.
- Harness is not required but recommended for beginners as it's easy to control him if he pulls.
- He's generally good with other dogs, though not always interested.
- If he stops, pause for a bit and try moving again.  Usually waiting will get him unstuck, though he occasionally needs a sustained pull to jumpstart him.
