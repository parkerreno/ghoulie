# Troubleshooting
| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| He's not wagging his tail | Ghoulie does not wag his tail when interacting with people, only in anticipation |
| He's punching me | He wants you to pet him |
| He's aiming for my face | Be vigilant, dodge it |
| He won't stop punching me (2+ minutes) | He wants to use the bathroom or it's dinner time |
| He's kicking me | He probably doesn't like that (usually brushing) |
| Not eating breakfast after going out | If you've let him out before breakfast, you will need to bring his bowl to him at a later time to get him to eat |
| Barking | You will typically need to go look at what he's seeing and tell him it's ok |
| He's stopped walking | If his leash is tangled in his legs, untangle.  If not, wait for a bit, try again |
